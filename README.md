# StoryMap

My storymap is meant to illustrate a small sliver of my time spent in Senegal as a Peace Corps Volunteer. Necessarily, for the scope of this project, I couldn't include every aspect of my service. Additionally, there is no narrative in a traditional sense. My service doesn't lend itself well to a story, but I felt that the story map format could still lend itself nicely towards describing aspects and locations of my service. Being able to see physically where my site was in Senegal in relation to the rest of the country and other villages, with information and photos alongside, helps to lend context to my village and my work there. 
For the storyline that exists, I felt it necessary to begin by showing the whole country and providing contextual information. 
The second scene adds more geographic context, as well as showing relative development of the different regions through the use of the electrical grid geojson. 
The third scene, Kedougou, narrows the scope of the story map to one particular region, and helps to focus the reader in on a specific place in Senegal.
The fourth scene takes the reader to my actual village, and provides information on my work habits, village life, and a sense of distance and remoteness.
The fifth scene helps again to show another place where I worked and learned, demonstrating that I also participated in Senegalese culture and life outside of my village.
Finally I wanted to show some levity and led the reader to Ingli, an idyllic waterfall. I felt that this was a good place to end, on a positive note.
